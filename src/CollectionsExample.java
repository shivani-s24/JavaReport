/* You are given a table, in which every key is a stringified number, and each corresponding value is an array of characters, e.g.

        {
        "1": ["A", "B", "C"],
        "2": ["A", "B", "D", "A"],
        }
        Create a function that returns a table with the same keys, but each character should appear only once among the value-arrays, e.g.

        {
        "1": ["C"],
        "2": ["A", "B", "D"],
        }
